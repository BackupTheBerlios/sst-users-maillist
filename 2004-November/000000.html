<PRE>(Submitted for archival purposes -- I'm not sure anyone has joined
this list yet.)

I've just created an actual project website, which includes a browseable
HTMLized version of the SST.DOC file.  See &lt;<A HREF="http://sst.berlios.de/">http://sst.berlios.de/</A>&gt;.

Here's what I've done to the code so far:

  * I converted the flat-text SST.DOC file to XML-Docbook so it can be
    webbed.

  * The command-help code needed a rewrite because the flat-text form of
    the documentation is now generated from XML and doesn't have the 
    easily recognizable section delimiter it used to .  I wrote a
    script to filter that flat-text form into an sst.doc that's easy
    to parse for command descriptions, and changed some logic in sst.c
    to match.  

  * I've cleaned up a lot of grubby FORTRANisms in the code internals --
    used sizeof(), replaced magic numeric constants with #defines,
    that sort of thing.

  * I fixed a surprising number of typos in the code and documentation.

  * All the game state now lives in one big structure that can be
    written to and read from disk as one blob.  The write gives it an
    an identifiable magic number and the thaw logic checks for same. 

Here's the current to-do list:

* Remove the assumption that sst.doc lives in the current directory.

* Have it read the value of LINES rather than assumong a 24-line terminal.

* Do a manual page.

* Improve the internal pager.

* Yes-no confirmations and &quot;press-to-continue&quot; situations should print
  a recognizable standard prompt.

* A real release, with downloadable tarballs and RPMs and so forth.

* The time-machine switch.  Specify a year, get only the features that
  then existed.  (This would be partly so people can try the original
  non-&quot;super&quot; version Matuszek and Reynolds wrote.)

  Dave Matuszek tells me that SRSCAN, MOVE, PHASERS, CALL, STATUS,
  IMPULSE, PHOTONS, ABANDON, LRSCAN, WARP, SHIELDS, DESTRUCT CHART,
  REST, DOCK, QUIT, and DAMAGE were in the original non-&quot;super&quot; version.

* Write a curses-based interface.  Shouldn't be hard, all output goes through
  prout/proutn/prouts so we can split the screen into two panes with the upper
  one for the charts.

Dave, did I get that non-Super command list right?   The full list of
commands is:

   SRSCAN    MOVE      PHASERS   CALL
   STATUS    IMPULSE   PHOTONS   ABANDON
   LRSCAN    WARP      SHIELDS   DESTRUCT
   CHART     REST      DOCK      QUIT
   DAMAGES   REPORT    SENSORS   ORBIT
   TRANSPORT MINE      CRYSTALS  SHUTTLE
   PLANETS   REQUEST   DEATHRAY  FREEZE
   COMPUTER  EMEXIT    PROBE     COMMANDS
   HELP

Also: did your version have

      Romulans
      Commanders
      Super-commanders

?

There's a tendency today to absolve individuals of
moral responsibility and treat them as victims of
social circumstance.  You buy that, you pay with your
soul.
